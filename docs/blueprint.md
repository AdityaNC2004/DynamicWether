# **App Name**: WeatherScape

## Core Features:

- Weather-Based Background: Dynamically render the website background to reflect real-time weather conditions (sunny, rainy, snowy, foggy, cloudy, partly cloudy).
- Time-of-Day Adaptation: Adapt the background theme to match the time of day (morning, noon, evening, night).
- Animated Sun/Moon Cycle: Animate the sun and moon across the sky in real-time based on local time, incorporating dynamic lighting and shadows.
- Themed Transitions: Create smooth transitions between various weather and time-of-day themes.
- Real-Time Weather Data: Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data for the user's location using their IP address.
- Persistent theme settings: Implement user preferences via browser storage (theme).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0C4FF) to represent the sky, transitioning through shades of orange and pink during sunrise and sunset.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue-gray (#E0F2F7) for daytime, darkening to a deep, desaturated indigo (#1E232F) for nighttime.
- Accent color: Warm yellow (#FFECB3) for sun and moon, providing contrast against the sky.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Use minimalist, animated icons for weather conditions, such as raindrops, snowflakes, and sun rays.
- Implement smooth, subtle animations for weather transitions, sun/moon movement, and cloud drifts.
